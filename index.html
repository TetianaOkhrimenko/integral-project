            According to Forbes, by 2050, IoT technology will be in 95% of
            electronics for new product designs. And by 2050 it is expected to
            have everything connected to the cloud and to the internet.
            According to Business Insider, Space tourism could be feasible in
            2050, but likely only for the very wealthy.

              producing cells that can restore muscle function to damaged hearts
              and create neurons that can replace parts of the brain.

          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning refer to the
            ability of machines to learn and act intelligently, meaning they can
            make decisions, carry out tasks, and even predict future outcomes
            based on what they learn from data. AI and machine learning already
            play a bigger role in everyday life than you might imagine. Alexa,
            Siri, Amazon's product recommendations, Netflix’s and Spotify’s
            personalized recommendations, every Google search you make, security
            checks for fraudulent credit card purchases, dating apps, fitness
            trackers... All are driven by AI.

          <h2>Gene Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of biology that focuses on
            the understanding and manipulation of DNA and genomes of living
            organisms. Gene editing is a group of technologies that enables
            genetic engineering in order to change the DNA and genetic structure
            of living organisms. Biotechnology is advancing to the point where
            it's viable to alter the DNA encoded within a cell; this will
            influence the characteristics or traits that its descendants will
            have. In plants, this could affect the number of leaves or their
            coloring, while in humans, it could affect their height, eye color,
            or their likelihood of developing diseases.

          <p>
            Human-computer interfaces create wearable devices and technology
            that help to improve the physical and potentially mental performance
            of humans and help us lead healthier and better lives. Perhaps the
            most prevalent examples of wearables today are fitness tracker bands
            and smartwatches: small, easy to wear devices that typically monitor
            our activity and provide insights that help us lead healthier,
            better, more productive lives.

          <p>
            Extended reality, or XR for short, encompasses virtual reality,
            augmented reality, and mixed reality and refers to the use of
            technology to create more immersive digital experiences. In
            practice, XR is being used to boost brand engagement, let customers
            try before they buy, enhance customer service, make workplace
            learning more effective, and improve other organizational processes.
            XR Technologies offer exciting and entirely new ways for people to
            experience the world around them.

          <h2>3D Printing</h2>
          <p>
            3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, means creating a
            3D object from a digital file by building it layer by layer. 3D
            printing may seem distinctly more low-tech than artificial
            intelligence or gene editing, but it has the potential to completely
            transform manufacturing and other industries. Using 3D printing, the
            factories of the future could quickly print spare parts for
            machinery on site. Entire assembly lines could be replaced with 3D
            printers. We could print human tissue for transplant, print weapons,
            even print food.

          <p>
            Not new in the game but new in popularity. Biometric tech is here to
            see its biggest acceptance. A recent survey of security
            professionals revealed that 72 percent of companies are planning to
            drop traditional passwords by 2025. This will lead to a rise in
            fresh authorization services. It will include the face, eye, voice,
            hand, and signature identifications.
